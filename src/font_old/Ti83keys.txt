                             --------------
      
      This document is part of a package distributed by Texas Instruments
      through the GRAPH-TI e-mail special interest group.
      
      The package contains font files for schools who need to include
      key symbols for the Texas Instruments TI-83 and TI-83 Plus
      in their Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) and Macintosh(R) documents.
      
      This document describes how to install and use the TI-83 font.
      
      ----------
      Background
      ----------
      A number of teachers and schools have requested TI's help in
      producing printed educational materials that contain the key
      symbols printed on the TI-83. TI is distributing, for limited use,
      the scaleable outline font used in the TI-83 manual and other
      printed materials.
      
      Originally, the font was created with Fontographer for Windows as a
      PostScript(R) font for Adobe Type Manager(R) for Windows. It has
      been converted to the other formats to accommodate both ATM and
      TrueType(R) users, on both PCs and Macintoshes.
      
      -------------------
      System Requirements
      -------------------
      To use the font on a PC, you must have:
      *  Windows 3.0 or later, with ATM.
         or
      *  Windows 3.1 or later, with either ATM or TrueType.
      
      ---------------------------------------
      Installing the TrueType Font on Your PC
      ---------------------------------------

      2. Open the Windows Control Panel.

      6. Highlight the font name "TI83Key (TrueType)" and select
         "OK." Windows adds the font to your font list and shows you a
         small sample of the symbols in the font.

      ----------------------------------
      Installing the ATM Font on Your PC

         PostScript .PFB files (usually C:\PSFONTS).
      
      2. Copy TI83____.PFM to the directory where you keep your
         PostScript .PFM files (usually C:\PSFONTS\PFM).
      
      3. Open the ATM Control Panel.
      
      4. Select "Add..."  ATM displays a listing of available fonts. (If
         necessary, set "Directories" to your .PFM directory.)
      
      5. Highlight the font name "TI83Key" and select "OK."
         ATM adds the font to your font list.

      Using the Font
      --------------
      Before using the font, please read the License Agreement at
      the end of this document. The agreement describes restrictions
      on how you may use the font.
      
      Once you have installed the font, you can use it with Windows
      and Mac applications that allow font selection. The name
      "TI83Key" should show in the font menus and font-
      selection dialog boxes of your applications.
      
      If your application does not have a specific feature for
      inserting special symbols, use this method to insert the
      "TI83Key" characters into your document:
      
      1. Move your cursor to the place where you want to insert a
         symbol. Then use your application's font menu or font dialog
         box to select "TI83Key".
      
      2. Press the key or Alt-key sequence shown in the attached Key Map
         for the symbol you want. "Alt 0150" means: Hold down the Alt
         key, type 0 1 5 0 on the numeric keypad, and then release
         the Alt key.
